# CIE-cement
## A mod for Derail Valley that adds cement cars used by Coras Iompar Éireann in the 20th century

### This mod adds the following rolling stock:
* CIÉ cement "bubble" car - white livery
* CIÉ cement "bubble" car - orange livery
* CIÉ Irish Cement bogie car

# THIS MOD REQUIRES BOTH CUSTOM CAR LOADER AND CUSTOM CARGO TO WORK
* Custom Car Loader: https://www.nexusmods.com/derailvalley/mods/324
* Custom Cargo: https://www.nexusmods.com/derailvalley/mods/907

This mod may be used with the Gauge mod (https://www.nexusmods.com/derailvalley/mods/563) to achieve maximum accuracy. Select the Custom rail gauge preset and enter "1600" in the "Gauge (millimeters)" field.
